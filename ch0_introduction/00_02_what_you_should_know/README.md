# 00_02 What You Should Know

## CI/CD/CD
Here's a summary of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
  - Developers work on their code in a local environment and commit their changes to a shared repository regularly.
  - Code integration involves combining new code with existing repository code.
  - The new code undergoes testing to identify and resolve errors quickly.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
  - A complementary process to continuous integration.
  - Allows developers to build, test, and release their software with every new change.
  - Includes testing to ensure the final product meets requirements and avoids bugs.

- **Continuous Deployment**
  - Refers to automated deployment without human interaction.
  - The application is automatically built, tested, and deployed into a production environment.
