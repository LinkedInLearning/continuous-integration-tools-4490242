# 00_02 What You Should Know

## CI/CD/CD
Here's a summary of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
  - Developers work on their code in a local environment and commit their changes to a shared repository regularly.
  - Code integration involves combining new code with existing repository code.
  - The new code undergoes testing to identify and resolve errors quickly.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
  - A complementary process to continuous integration.
  - Allows developers to build, test, and release their software with every new change.
  - Includes testing to ensure the final product meets requirements and avoids bugs.

- **Continuous Deployment**
  - Refers to automated deployment without human interaction.
  - The application is automatically built, tested, and deployed into a production environment.

## Exercise Files
The exercise files contain instructions and details to enhance your learning experience with the tools being discussed.

To get the most out of the exercise files, it will be helpful if you have some of the following:

- Familiarity with application development and the software development process.
- Experience in building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Experience with scripting and using a command-line interface.
- Familiarity with source code management tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, or Gitlab.
