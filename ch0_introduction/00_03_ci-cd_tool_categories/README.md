# 00_03 CI/CD Tool Categories
Generally speaking, we can sort CI/CD tools into four categories.

- **Self-Hosted Tools:**
  - Run on your hardware, which could be a server in your company's data center, a cloud-based virtual machine (VM), or your local workstation.
  - You are responsible for installing and maintaining the tool.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS) Tools:**
  - Vendors provide and maintain the tool and allow you to access it.
  - No installation or maintenance is required from you.

- **Cloud Service Providers:**
  - Offer SaaS-based CI/CD tools along with other cloud-based services such as virtual machines, managed services, and storage.

- **Code Repositories:**
  - Primarily known for storing and managing code.
  - Many modern repositories also offer CI/CD tools for transforming code into software.
